# Sampling

This Assignment involves:
- Convertng the dataset 'data.csv' into balanced class dataset.
- Creating five samples using five different sampling techniques.
- Applying five different ML models on them.
- Determining which sampling technique gives higher accuracy on which model.

# Sampling techniques used
- **Simple Random Sampling**- Pick the sample at random

- **Systematic Sampling**- Samples are chosen at random intervals.
- **Stratified Sampling**- The population is divided into subgroups or strata based on a certain characteristic. Individual elements from a sub-population can be randomly selected.

- **Cluster Sampling**- The entire population is divided into smaller groups and then a random sample of these clusters is selected. The sample size is then selected on the basis of sample size.
